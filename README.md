# Toolbox for Bioinformatic Tools

  Since the microarray technology has continuously advanced, many techniques used to identify
diagnostic markers by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles have emerged. Gene expression
is shown as colors on a microarray plate. These colors will be converted to numerical data representing
gene expressions, and these numerical data will be used in identifying diagnostic markers.
