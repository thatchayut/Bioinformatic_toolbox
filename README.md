# Toolbox for Bioinformatic Tools

Since the microarray technology has continuously advanced, many techniques used to identifydiagnostic markers by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles have emerged. Gene expressionis shown as colors on a microarray plate. These colors will be converted to numerical data representing gene expressions, and these numerical data will be used in identifying diagnostic markers. 
  
Many research studies show that using **_pathways_** (or groups) of genes that interact with each other in molecular level to identify genes that are used to classify an occurence of a specific disease yields more *reliability* and *reproducibility* compared with using genes themselves to identify diagnostic markers.

This toolbox offers multiple existing pathway-based classification methods including *Mean*, *[Condition-Responsive Genes (CORGs)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563693/)* , and *[Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781165/)*.
