# Toolbox for Bioinformatic Tools

  Since the microarray technology has continuously advanced, many techniques used to identifydiagnostic markers by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles have emerged. Gene expressionis shown as colors on a microarray plate. These colors will be converted to numerical data representing gene expressions, and these numerical data will be used in identifying diagnostic markers.
