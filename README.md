# Toolbox for Bioinformatic Tools

Since the microarray technology has continuously advanced, many techniques used to identifydiagnostic markers by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles have emerged. Gene expressionis shown as colors on a microarray plate. These colors will be converted to numerical data representing gene expressions, and these numerical data will be used in identifying diagnostic markers. 
  
However, many researches show that using *pathways* (or groups) of genes that interact with each other in molecular level to identify genes that are used to classify an occurence of a specific disease yields more *reliability* and *reproducibility* compared with using genes themselves to identify diagnostic markers.
